# Treeroot

Treeroot is a Bitcoin-native DeFi project that turns social energy into tradable value. We use the Taproot Asset Protocol to mint and track digital assets on Bitcoin, tightly integrated with X.com and powered by AI. In plain English: creators and communities can launch “social assets” tied to memes or tweet moments, and people can buy, sell, and collect them—coordinated right on X.com, settled with Bitcoin-level security.

## Why this matters

1. Culture moves first: Memes and tweets drive attention before markets catch up. Treeroot gives culture a price and a receipt.
2. Social-first discovery: Trading happens where the crowd already is—on X.com—so discovery and liquidity are native, not hidden in a silo.
3. Bitcoin security: Assets are recorded with verifiable proofs using the Taproot Asset Protocol, giving strong guarantees without trusted middlemen.
4. AI simplicity: LLMs explain actions, simulate outcomes, and guard your settings so you don’t make costly mistakes.

## How “meme/tweet trading” works

1. Mint a moment: A creator or community mints a limited “moment asset” tied to a meme or a specific tweet (via tweet ID and metadata). Proofs anchor the asset to Bitcoin so the supply and ownership are verifiable.
2. Announce on X.com: The creator posts the drop details. A Treeroot bot can attach a verified card showing supply, rules, and links to proofs.
3. Post intents as replies: Buyers reply with simple messages like “Buy 3 at 7k sats” or “Sell 2 at market.” These become public, machine-readable intents.
4. Match and settle: Orders are matched; settlement happens with Bitcoin-backed proofs. Buyers get the asset; sellers get sats. Receipts are posted back to X.com.
5. Use and trade: Hold, trade in threads, unlock perks (access, merch, token-gated spaces), or tip creators. Secondary trading follows the same public-intent flow.

## What AI does for you

1. Explain: “What am I buying? Who issued it? What’s the supply?” Get clear summaries before acting.
2. Simulate: “If price drops 20%, what’s my PnL?” or “What if I market-buy 10 now?”
3. Guardrails: Enforce your policies like max spend, slippage limits, and blocklists. The AI never acts outside your signed rules.

## Safety and trust

1. Proof-first: Every mint, trade, and transfer is backed by cryptographic proofs on Bitcoin.
2. Transparent markets: Public intents on X.com reduce hidden order flow and help price discovery.
3. Privacy options: Share only what’s necessary—prove ownership or settlement without exposing unrelated addresses.

## Examples and use cases

1. Meme drops: Limited “MemeCards” celebrating a viral trend; royalties can flow back to creators.
2. Tweet moments: Assets representing a specific post (e.g., a landmark announcement or viral thread).
3. Community games: Buy walls, prediction threads, market-making contests—all coordinated in replies.
4. Creator perks: Holders unlock AMAs, private chats, early releases, or discounts.

## Quick start (at a glance)

1. Creators: Mint a limited asset, post your drop, let the crowd bid in replies, and settle on Bitcoin.
2. Traders: Discover drops in your feed, reply with buy/sell intents, confirm, and receive assets with proofs.
3. Communities: Use social allowlists (followers, hashtag participants) and fair mints to reward real supporters.

## Contributing and contact

We’re building in the open and value feedback from creators, traders, and builders. If you’re interested in testing drops, integrating bots, or shaping the standard for social assets on Bitcoin, reach out via issues or discussions, or connect with us on X.com. Treeroot makes social value tradable—secure on Bitcoin, discoverable on X.com, and understandable with AI.
